# Chest-XRay-classification---PyTorch
My take on https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia dataset using transfer learning <br />
Model checkpoints are available via Google Drive --> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rZ8FixPrRzBQi9OX_gAJWXVfXPKyqjLV?usp=sharing <br />
Take notice i moved ~600 images from training dataset to validation dataset, since the initial ratio of train to val datasets was around 11% and thus caused the model to overfit
